## Functionality

This is the [linked lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists) project, which serves to introduce data structures by creating linked lists.

## Methods

| Method                   | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #append(value)           | Adds a new node containing value to the end of the list                                                  |
| #prepend(value)          | Adds a new node containing value to the beginning of the list                                            |
| #size                    | Returns the total number of nodes in the list                                                            |
| #head                    | Returns the first node in the list                                                                       |
| #tail                    | Returns the last node in the list                                                                        |
| #at(index)               | Returns the node at the given index                                                                      |
| #pop                     | Removes the last element from the list                                                                   |
| #contains?(value)        | Returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.                          |
| #find(value)             | Returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.                                     |
| #to_s                    | Represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. |
| #insert_at(value, index) | Inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.                                           |
| #remove_at(index)        | Removes the node at the given index.                                                                     |

## Thoughts

Wasn't too bad! Compared too the OG C Language when doing linked lists problems, this approach is way more straightforward,
bypassing the need to fuss over pointers and memory addresses!
